# GienoDeSofi
Wrote this birthday program for Sofi by adapting project codes from CSC207 class 

# How it works
Firslty, it will prompt each player to key in their identification information in the form of questions to build a knowledge tree. 
Then the host(Sofi) will play the game by answering the series of questions to identify who is the person she is thinking of. 
Finally, prize/penalty!
